🔧 MERN Stack Developer Test Task
🧪 Task Title: "Collaborative Project Management Tool"
📋 Objective:
Build a simplified project management web application that allows users to:
● Register and log in
● Create and manage projects
● Add tasks to projects
● Collaborate with team members
● Track project progress with status updates
🕰 Estimated Time to Complete:
12–15 hours (not all at once – this simulates a real-world sprint)
 Technical Requirements
Frontend:
● React.js with functional components and Hooks
● Global state management (e.g., Context API or Redux)
● Responsive UI using any UI framework (MUI, Bootstrap, Tailwind, or custom CSS)
● React Router for page navigation
Backend:
● Node.js + Express.js
● RESTful API with CRUD operations
● JWT-based authentication and route protection
Database:
● MongoDB (use MongoDB Atlas or local instance)
Features to Implement:
🔐 Authentication:
● User registration & login
● JWT token handling
● Role support: Admin, Member
📁 Project Management:
● Create, edit, delete projects
● Assign team members to projects
● Only project owners can edit/delete the project
📝 Task Management:
● Create tasks under projects
● Assign task status (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Completed)
● Track tasks per user
👥 Team Collaboration:
● Add/remove users from projects
● View tasks assigned to each team member
📊 Dashboard:
● Show stats like total projects, completed tasks, pending tasks
📦 Bonus (Optional, but appreciated):
● Use of TypeScript
● Dockerize the app
● Unit and integration tests (Jest, React Testing Library, Mocha, etc.)
● Deployment on Render, Vercel, Netlify, or any free-tier cloud
🚫 Restrictions
● Do not use pre-built project templates (e.g., create-react-app boilerplates are okay,
but no low-code platforms)
● Do not use code generators (e.g., Copilot, AI code completion tools)
● Code must be clean, modular, and readable with meaningful commit history
● Do not hardcode sensitive data (use .env for secrets/configs)
